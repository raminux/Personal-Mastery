I am changing my destructive mental models to see and interact with the world from a new 
perspective. 

I have the choice of determining what emotional domain I occupy. In other words, in any situation, 
it depends on myself to choose how to feel and what to think about that specific circumstance. Also, 
I'm at the charge of exercising that choice or decision. In my daily life, I am exposed to such 
emotional domain and It is upon me to chose and exercise the most effective decision. 

Today's exercise is about choosing alternate realities. 
1- Pick a situation currently taking emotinal energy.

2- Write down that situation:
----> My low income is currently draining my energy. 
This is just 'a reality' not 'the reality.' 

3- Construct an alternative reality. 
----> My income is low because I don't invest parts of my money. So, an alternative reality
would be to increase my financial knowledge and my relationship to money. This way, I can manage
 my money professionally. 

4- Start living as if 'the alternative reality' were 'the reality.'
As I do in this manner, I'll find a lot of evidence that: 
|---> it is not working ==> throw them out.
|
|---> it is working ==> rejoice in it ==> and most importantly write it down. 

5- work hard in order to tip over into the alternative reality.
