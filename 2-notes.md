What is a mental model?
The notion that I have about how the world works.

Mental models are all inside our brains about the world. The problem is that 
we don't recognize our mental models and just think that this is the way that 
world works. This is where the problem arises. Because, our mental models change 
our perceptions about the world. We need to change our mental models to change 
our perception and also our external world. As we change our internal world, our 
external world starts to change. 
In other words, mental models are actually our beliefs about the world. 
By recognizing and changing out beliefs, our worlds will change without any doubt. 

So start now to identify your beliefs in each of those important categories of 
your life and jot them down into your journal. Then, it is time to change those limiting
beliefs and live in the world of abundance.
