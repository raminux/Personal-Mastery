# You shoot yourself by sticking labels

## Important points

- Suffering does not happen when the event occures but when
  you label that experience bad.

- In hindsight, events in the past CAN TURN OUT to be GOOD.

- Ask yourself what you CAN DO to turn the bad thing into something GOOD.

## Exercise

1. Identify a situation you have arbitrarily labeled it as bad.
2. Ask if this could turn out to be THE BEST THING that happened to you.
3. What can you DO to make it the best thing that happened to you?
