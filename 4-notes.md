Why and how you became what you are?

Who I am today is a result of the stories I tell myself about what happened in the past.

Today's exercise:

1- Go back as far as you can.
2- Make list of significant events in your life. If you remember them with any degree of emotion
, they were probably significant. 
---- What was the event?
---- When did it happen?
---- What is the lesson you learned?

3- Recognize that the lesson you learned is probably a story that you're telling yourself, 
not something that is true, but something that you believe. Look carefully at these beliefs, 
ARE THOS beliefs TRUELY SERVING YOU?

4- Consciously recognize those beliefs that do not serve you. Release them.
