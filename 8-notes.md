# Drop That Baggage! Your Journey Will Be Easier!
Here, I'm going to learn the importance of letting go and integrating it into my day to day life. 

The baggage of events you carry today continue to shape and affect your current life. 

The train is big and powerful enough to carry you and your suitcases. You do not have to carry the suitcases on YOUR HEAD. Some events and experiences act as anchors that hold us back to the past and prevent us from moving forward. 

## Exercise of the day
1- Are there major events in the past that you cannot let go? 
At the moment, I don't remember any event that ties me to the past. 

2- What can you do to et go of that anchor?
