# Positive Thinking is Excellent But Here is Something Even Better

The very term of ==positive thinking== implies that there is something negative and you're overcoming it. 

- Not judging situations as positive or negative opens up greater acceptance of situations **AS THEY ARE**. 

- Posititve thinking is not needed if you focus on **Doing What You Need to Do** to change the situation. 

## Next steps

1. Do not label situations as good or bad.
2. Merely recognize what happened.
3. Ask yourself,"what do I have to do?"
