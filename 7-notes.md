# Taming the horse, it isn't easy, but it can be done!

## Your problems don't exist outside, they exist inside!!!

- We tell stories about how things are going to be in the future, and we delve into despair or ascend into elation, and we all manufacture it within our heads.

### Summary

- Most problems exist not in the reality of the world, but inside your head.
- The stories we tell ourselves set up an expectation of how stories might unfold in the future.
- Where do you fit on the continuum of being able to move on and holding onto tragedy?
- What makes it a tragedy is the story you MAKE UP about it.

#### Exercise

1- Think about any event in your life that you classify as tragedy.
2- Revisit that tragedy. Let the emotions play in your head.
3- Recognize that you made it all up.
