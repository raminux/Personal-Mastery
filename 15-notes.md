# Appreciation and Gratitude
- Our life is an endless story of wanting more, accumulating more and ignoring what we already have. 
- Instead, focus on the blessings you do have in your life but ignored.

## Next steps
1. Make a list of at least 3 things you are grateful for in your life.
2. **FEEL** the ==GRATITUDE==.
